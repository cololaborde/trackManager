# TrackManager

Track Manager is an Android application that allows you to control music playback by switching to the next song using a double-tap on the volume down button of a connected Bluetooth speaker or headset.

Is useful for Bluetooth speakers or headphones without music control buttons. It lets you skip to the next song by double-tapping the volume down button, allowing hands-free music navigation without touching your phone.
